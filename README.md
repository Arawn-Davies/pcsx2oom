# PCSX2OOM
Simple port of DOOM to the Playstation 2
A few ports of DOOM have been created for the PS2 by te homebrew scene, 
but they're outdated and use old versions of the PS2SDK and toolchain.
This project aims to fix this and update functions so it builds in the latest 
PS2DEV project and eventually add new features such as USB peripheral support, networking and PWAD loading
